# CantysToolbox_Objects
Repository containing objects and niche features for my toolbox for Unity. Everything is still WIP, comments and bug reports are encouraged. Requires CantysToolbox_Core to properly compile.

Current To-Do List :
- Create a more thorough way to credit the original creator of some of the features.
- Properly document the current features.
- Create a proper test scene and manually test every features, both for debugging purposes and gather my own material for the wiki.
